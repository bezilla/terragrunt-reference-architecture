# WAFv2 web ACL (CLOUDFRONT scope → must be created in us-east-1).
#
# A stack of AWS-managed rule groups plus a rate-based rule. The managed groups cover the OWASP
# common set, known-bad inputs, and IP reputation; the rate rule caps per-IP request volume. This
# uses AWS-managed rules in place of a hand-maintained reputation-list Lambda.
